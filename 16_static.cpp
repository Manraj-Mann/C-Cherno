    // Static has 2 meanings and it depends on the context 

    // static outside class - linkage is internal x
    // static insides class - varible s going to share the memory in all instances of the class ( or all objects of class)

    // similar apply to static methods

    static int s_var = 2; // will be linked internally in this translaional unit 

    // linker is not going to look out to link this checkout 16_static2.cpp
